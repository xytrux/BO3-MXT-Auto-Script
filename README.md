# BO3-MXT-Auto-Script

Automate the DLL injection for MXT

## Please Note
* This only works for 64-bit processors for now. Making a version for ARM and 32-bit soon.
* If you choose to use this menu, I STRONGLY advice against scripting and injecting modified stat files as those have ***THE HIGHEST*** chance of getting you banned. Everything else is still safe as of ```1/17/2025```.
* I also **HIGHLY** advise ***AGAINST*** using the menu in public lobbies or even play with the menu at all. This menu is strictly for unlocking Liquid Divinium, black market items/camos, modding your level and should not be used and abused for legitimate play.
* If the MXT Menu file will not download, you may have to temporarily disable antivirus, however that is **VERY** rare, I didn't myself and neither has anyone I've given this too, if you absolutely must, make sure to turn it back on **IMMEDIATELY** after!

## Usage

Basically the same as MXT

1. Open the game
2. Go to `Multiplayer`
3. Run `autoinject.bat`
5. Mess around in the menu
6.  Have fun.

If you close the menu, simply press `F5` and it will bring it up again.

## Tips

* Do not run the auto-giver and auto-spender at the same time.
* If your LD stops giving or spending then uncheck and recheck start. (Mess around with the interval and eventually it will go forever)
* When using the black market spoofer, you have to create custom loadouts with the dark matter camo on for the camo to save.
* To get rid of the mod menu, simply restart your game.
